# ccn: Parse CMS Certification Numbers

An [S7 class](https://github.com/RConsortium/S7/) representing a **CMS
Certification Number**, a uniform way of identifying Providers or
Suppliers who have participated in the Medicare or Medicaid programs.

A CCN is an alphanumeric string, either 6 or 10 characters in length,
that encodes a Provider/Supplier's State and Facility type, as defined
by [CMS Manual System Pub.
100-07](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Transmittals/downloads/R3SOM.pdf)
*Medicare State Operations: Provider Certification*.
